# Document Proposal: Distribution Strategy for Tensor Parallel L-BFGS Optimizer

## 1. Introduction

This document proposes a distribution strategy for the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimization algorithm to enable efficient training of large, tensor-parallel models.  Traditional L-BFGS implementations are inherently sequential and memory-intensive, posing challenges for scaling to modern distributed training environments. This proposal outlines a method to distribute the L-BFGS optimizer itself, aiming to maximize parallelism and minimize computational bottlenecks when used with tensor-parallel models.

## 2. Proposed Distribution Strategy: Tensor Parallel L-BFGS

The core idea is to distribute the key components of the L-BFGS optimizer across multiple CUDA devices, mirroring the tensor parallelism of the model being optimized. This involves sharding the large vectors and the history used by L-BFGS, and implementing distributed versions of the core operations.

**2.1. Vector and History Sharding:**

- **Vectors to Shard:** The following vectors will be sharded across N devices (where N is the number of GPUs used for tensor parallelism):
    - `flat_grad`: The flattened gradient vector.
    - `q`:  The intermediate vector in the direction calculation (initialized to negative gradient).
    - `r/d`: The direction vector (and intermediate `r` vector).
    - `y`: Gradient difference vectors (used in history).
    - `s`: Step vectors (used in history).
- **History Sharding:** The history lists `old_dirs` and `old_stps` will also be sharded. Each device will store shards of the history vectors corresponding to its shard of the primary vectors (`q`, `r/d`, etc.).
- **Sharding Scheme:**  Vectors will be sharded along their first dimension (dimension 0) in a consistent manner across all relevant vectors.  For example, if vector size is M and N devices are used, each device will hold a shard of size M/N.
- **Replicated Scalars:** Scalar values used in L-BFGS, such as `H_diag`, `ys`, `ro[i]`, `al[i]`, `be_i`, will be replicated across all devices.

**2.2. Distributed Operations:**

All core vector operations within the L-BFGS direction calculation and parameter update will be implemented as distributed operations, requiring inter-device communication:

- **Distributed Dot Product:**  Dot products (e.g., `y.dot(s)`, `old_stps[i].dot(q)`) will be computed in a distributed manner. Each device calculates the dot product of its local shards, and then a `torch.distributed.all_reduce` operation (with `SUM`) will be used to aggregate the partial results from all devices to obtain the global dot product.
- **Distributed Vector Addition/Subtraction:** Vector addition and subtraction (e.g., `q.add_(...)`, `y.sub(...)`) will be performed element-wise on local shards. No communication is needed during the element-wise operation itself, assuming consistent sharding.
- **Distributed Element-wise Multiplication:** Element-wise multiplication (e.g., `torch.mul(q, H_diag)`) with a replicated scalar will be performed locally on each device's shard.
- **Distributed Norm Calculation:** Vector norms, if needed in a distributed version, would also require distributed summation of squared elements and a global square root. (Though the current proposal simplifies to dot product without normalization).

**2.3. Parallelizing Direction Approximation (Two-Loop Recursion):**

The two-loop recursion at the heart of L-BFGS direction calculation will be parallelized as follows:

- **Backward Loop:**
    - Each device will iterate through its local shards of the history (`old_stps`, `old_dirs`).
    - Distributed dot products will be used to calculate `al[i]` coefficients.
    - Distributed vector addition will be used to update the sharded `q` vector.
- **Forward Loop:**
    - Similarly, each device will iterate through its local history shards.
    - Distributed dot products will calculate `be_i` coefficients.
    - Distributed vector addition will update the sharded `r` vector.

## 3. Challenges and Considerations

Implementing a fully distributed tensor-parallel L-BFGS optimizer presents significant challenges:

- **Code Complexity:**  The implementation will be considerably more complex than a sequential L-BFGS.  Distributed data management, communication primitives, and correct synchronization need careful handling.
- **Communication Overhead:** Distributed dot products and any necessary data redistribution will introduce communication overhead. The efficiency of the distribution strategy will heavily depend on minimizing communication and maximizing parallel computation.
- **Synchronization:** Distributed operations inherently involve synchronization points.  Excessive synchronization can limit parallelism and reduce performance gains.
- **Load Balancing:** Ensuring even workload distribution across devices is crucial. Uneven sharding or computational imbalances could lead to inefficiencies.
- **Line Search in Distributed Setting:**  The line search (`_strong_wolfe`) needs to be adapted for the distributed setting. Options include centralized line search (potential bottleneck) or a distributed line search approach (increased complexity).
- **Debugging and Testing:**  Developing and debugging distributed algorithms is more challenging. Thorough testing and profiling will be essential to validate correctness and performance.

## 4. Hybrid Approach (Comparison)

It's important to contrast this ambitious tensor-parallel L-BFGS strategy with the more common and practical **hybrid Data Parallelism + Tensor Parallelism** approach.  In the hybrid approach:

- L-BFGS optimizer instances are *replicated* across data parallel ranks, not sharded.
- Tensor parallelism is used *within* each data parallel rank for model layers, but the optimizer itself remains largely sequential within each rank.
- Communication is primarily for gradient reduction in data parallelism.

The proposed tensor-parallel L-BFGS strategy is significantly more complex than the hybrid approach.  It aims for a higher degree of parallelism within the optimizer itself, potentially reducing computational bottlenecks in the direction calculation for extremely large models. However, it also introduces substantial engineering challenges and communication overhead that need to be carefully managed.

## 5. Conclusion

Distributing the L-BFGS optimizer using tensor parallelism is a challenging but potentially rewarding endeavor for training extremely large models. By sharding vectors and history and implementing distributed operations, we aim to maximize parallelism in the direction approximation step.  However, significant engineering effort will be required to address the complexities of distributed implementation, communication overhead, and synchronization.  Careful profiling and benchmarking will be crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy compared to simpler hybrid approaches and to identify scenarios where the added complexity provides tangible performance benefits.

This document serves as a starting point for further investigation and development of a distributed tensor-parallel L-BFGS optimizer.
