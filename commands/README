This directory holds custom commands for ed. Anytime some automation is introduced as an extension from vanilla ed it will be added here in a .c file.
The format for these commands will be int funcname(const char *ibufpp, int *start, int *end, ...args...){
Where start and end are the line addresses from main_loop.c, int is the return error code, and ibufpp is the main line buffer for editing.
These commands can be passed null for start and end addresses if they do not take them.
The file command_parser.c contains the main loop for command parsing, called at the end of the main switch statement in main_loop.c
Dependency is as follows, all .c files are included in command_parse which is included in main_loop.c
