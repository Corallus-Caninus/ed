TODO: clean this up to explain the easiest way to add a custom extension command to ed
This directory holds custom extensions for ed. Anytime some automation is introduced as an extension from vanilla ed it will be added here in a .c file.
The format for these extensions will be int funcname(const char *ibufpp, int *start, int *end, ...args...){
Where start and end are the line addresses from main_loop.c, int is the return error code, and ibufpp is the main line buffer for editing.
These extensions can be passed null for start and end addresses if they do not take them.
The file extension_parser.c contains the main loop for extension parsing, called at the end of the main switch statement in main_loop.c
Dependency is as follows, all .c files are included in extension_parse which is included in main_loop.c
